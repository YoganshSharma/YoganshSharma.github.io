Preparing for the new year by starting a blog.

### Who am I?
Just a random guy on the internet trying to freely convey his thoughts.
If you wanna know more about me then see [the home page](/).

### What is this about?
This is a place on the internet where I am in control 
I will try to write about all the nerdy tech stuff that I come across.
My blogs will be highly informal depending on my mood.
I will try to be consistent and write atleast one blog per week.


### Why am I doing this?
- I want to document my journey.
- I want to improve my English and writing.
- It is cool!!!
