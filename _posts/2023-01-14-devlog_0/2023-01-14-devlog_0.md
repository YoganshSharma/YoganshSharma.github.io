Godot 4.0 is in beta now, and I have wanted to learn game dev for a long
time. So I downloaded [godot 4.0 beta 10](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-10).

### Why Godot?


Lately there has been a lot of hype around Godot 4.0.
I have taken a look at Godot and Unity before, and I liked the interface of 
godot more than unity ; also it was:-
- Much lighter 
- Open source: I am in complete control of what I create
- I prefer nodes over monobehaviour

So to refresh my memory a bit a started reading the [godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/)
But that was quite boring so I decided to make a small project to make myself familiar with the godot interface.
I decided to create a [boid simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).

After a lot of fiddling I got it working.
